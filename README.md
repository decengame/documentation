## What is it?

DecedGame stands for Decentralized Educational Game. A play-to-earn game where the main idea is to bring new people to Ethereum space, make them to study how it works, make them operate EVM compatible blockchains, having fun and earn tokens.

## How it works

Players are invited to join a board where they navigate thru different EVM compatible blockchains. They start the game with some amount of coins and in each blockchain they can buy a specific crypto asset deployed in this blockchain. They move in other of appearance and the numbers of blockchain they move is based on the latest number of the latest Ethereum block. After the move, if they get in a blockchain that asset already have an owner they neeed to rent or buy it. 

Who define the assets, receive the payment for the initial sale and also define assets' initial price are defined by the Godmasters Developers - Core Devs DAO that have built the game node softwares. The assets prices are reajusted up 5% each time some player pays a rent. The rent price is 10% of the asset price.

If the player does not have money to pay the rent she/he needs to answer a question showing her/his knowledge about Ethereum. If she/he fails to answer correctly they lost game and leave the board. If she/he does not want to take risk to miss the question, they can hire the "Specialists" - Ethereum specialists that put in stake some assets and then can be hired to answer the questions for the players - and if the question correctly answered by the specialist they can still to play.

The game is endless. Players can access different boards. The cheastest one are for new begginers and the expensive ones - accessible only if the player holds NFT proven they have previous experience - are for advanced Ethereum users.
